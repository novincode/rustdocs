# 🔗 References & Borrowing in Rust

<Alert variant="success">
  <AlertTitle>Why Borrowing?</AlertTitle>
  <AlertDescription>
    References let you **access data without taking ownership**. This is how Rust lets you write safe, fast code—no garbage collector, no memory bugs!

## 📌 What Is a Reference?

A **reference** lets you **borrow** a value **without taking ownership**.

<CodeBlock language="rust" showLineNumbers>{`fn main() {
    let s1 = String::from("hello");
    let len = calculate_length(&s1); // Borrowing with &

    println!("The length of '{}' is {}.", s1, len); // ✅ s1 still valid!
}

fn calculate_length(s: &String) -> usize {
    s.len()
}`}</CodeBlock>

`&s1` creates a **reference to `s1`**, and the function `calculate_length` borrows it.

✅ This means the original value **isn’t moved**, and you can still use it later!

---

## 📏 Immutable References (the default)

By default, references are **immutable**, meaning you can *read* the data but not *change* it.

<CodeBlock language="rust" showLineNumbers>{`fn main() {
    let s = String::from("hello");
    print_string(&s); // OK

    // s is still valid here
}

fn print_string(text: &String) {
    println!("{}", text);
}`}</CodeBlock>

You can create **multiple immutable references** at the same time:

<CodeBlock language="rust" showLineNumbers>{`let s = String::from("hi");
let r1 = &s;
let r2 = &s;

println!("{}, {}", r1, r2); // ✅ works!`}</CodeBlock>

---

## 🛠️ Mutable References

If you want to **change** a borrowed value, you need a **mutable reference** using `&mut`:

<CodeBlock language="rust" showLineNumbers>{`fn main() {
    let mut s = String::from("hello");
    change(&mut s);
    println!("{}", s); // "hello, world"
}

fn change(some_string: &mut String) {
    some_string.push_str(", world");
}`}</CodeBlock>

👉 **Rules for mutable references**:
- You can have **only ONE** mutable reference to a piece of data **at a time**.

❌ This won't work:

<CodeBlock language="rust" showLineNumbers>{`let mut s = String::from("oops");
let r1 = &mut s;
let r2 = &mut s; // ❌ Error: cannot borrow 's' as mutable more than once`}</CodeBlock>

Rust enforces this at compile-time to prevent **data races**.

✅ But you *can* use a mutable reference after an earlier one is done:

<CodeBlock language="rust" showLineNumbers>{`let mut s = String::from("okay");

{
    let r1 = &mut s;
    r1.push_str("!");
} // r1 goes out of scope here

let r2 = &mut s; // Now this is OK`}</CodeBlock>

---

## 🚫 Dangling References

Rust **does not allow dangling references** — that is, references to data that no longer exists:

<CodeBlock language="rust" showLineNumbers>{`// ❌ Won't compile
fn dangle() -> &String {
    let s = String::from("nope");
    &s // Error: 's' will be dropped!
}`}</CodeBlock>

The value `s` gets dropped at the end of the function. Returning a reference to it would be dangerous, so Rust **prevents** this entirely. 🛡️

## 🧠 Summary

- `&T` = immutable reference (read-only)
- `&mut T` = mutable reference (can modify the value)
- Multiple **immutable** references are allowed
- Only **one mutable** reference is allowed at a time
- References let you **borrow data without taking ownership**
- Rust stops you from using invalid or dangling references at compile time

This is one of Rust’s superpowers: **you can write fast, safe code without fear of memory bugs** 💥🦀
