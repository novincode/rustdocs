# 🦀 Getting Started with Rust

<Alert variant="success">
  <AlertTitle>Welcome!</AlertTitle>
  <AlertDescription>
    Whether you're here to build lightning-fast web apps, master systems programming, or just explore a powerful new language — <strong>Rust</strong> has your back.
  </AlertDescription>
</Alert>

In this quick guide, you'll set up your environment and write your very first Rust program. It's gonna be smooth, fun, and beginner-friendly — promise! 😄

## 📥 Step 1: Install Rust

Rust has an official installer that works on <strong>macOS</strong>, <strong>Linux</strong>, and <strong>Windows</strong>.

<CodeBlock language="bash">{`curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh`}</CodeBlock>

<Alert variant="secondary">
  <AlertDescription>
    ✅ This will install <code>rustc</code> (the compiler), <code>cargo</code> (the package manager), and <code>rustup</code> (the version manager).
  </AlertDescription>
</Alert>

After it's done, restart your terminal and check:

<CodeBlock language="bash">{`rustc --version`}</CodeBlock>
<CodeBlock language="bash">{`cargo --version`}</CodeBlock>

Boom 💥! You're ready.

## 📂 Step 2: Create Your First Project

Let’s make a simple Rust app (no setup hell here 😌):

<CodeBlock language="bash">{`cargo new hello-rust
cd hello-rust`}</CodeBlock>

You'll see:

```text
hello-rust/
 ┣ Cargo.toml       // Project config & dependencies
 ┗ src/
   ┗ main.rs        // Your code lives here
```

Now run your app:

<CodeBlock language="bash">{`cargo run`}</CodeBlock>

And you’ll see:

```text
Hello, world!
```

🎉 Congrats — you just wrote and ran your first Rust program!

## 🛠 What's Next?

Here’s what you’ll learn next (don’t worry, it’s all broken down step-by-step in this guide):

- 📦 What <code>cargo</code> actually does (hint: it’s magic)
- 🧠 Variables, types, and functions in Rust
- 🔐 Memory safety without garbage collection
- 🧵 Ownership, borrowing, and lifetimes (explained with love, not fear)
- 🧪 Testing your code
- 🧰 Building command-line apps, APIs, and even web apps with Rust!

## 💬 Why Rust?

<RoundedCard>
  <ul>
    <li>🧠 <strong>Smart compiler</strong> that catches bugs before you even run your code</li>
    <li>🚀 <strong>Fast</strong> as C/C++ — but much safer</li>
    <li>📦 <strong>Rich ecosystem</strong> (check out <a href="https://crates.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener">crates.io</a>)</li>
    <li>🤝 Backed by a great community, awesome docs, and real-world use (Dropbox, AWS, Discord, etc.)</li>
  </ul>
</RoundedCard>

## 📚 Learn by Doing

This guide is hands-on. You’ll <strong>build real stuff</strong> while learning:

- A to-do app in the terminal 📝
- A basic API with <code>axum</code> 🌐
- A WASM-powered web app 💻
