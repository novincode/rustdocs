# 🦀 Say Hello to Rust – Your New Favorite Programming Language

<Alert>
  <AlertTitle>Why Rust?</AlertTitle>
  <AlertDescription>
    Imagine a language as fast as C++, but safer. One that helps you catch bugs <strong>before</strong> your code even runs. That language is <strong>Rust</strong>.
  </AlertDescription>
</Alert>

Rust is a systems programming language focused on <strong>speed</strong>, <strong>safety</strong>, and <strong>concurrency</strong>. But don’t let the “systems” part scare you—Rust is as great for building blazing-fast web apps as it is for writing low-level code that runs close to the metal.

    Rust isn't just for hardcore system engineers. It's for <strong>anyone</strong> who wants to write fast, reliable code—and <strong>learn a ton</strong> along the way.

Here's your first Rust program, with some highlighted features:

<CodeBlock
  language="rust"
  title="Hello World in Rust"
  showLineNumbers
  highlightLines={[2]}
  focusLines={[3]}
  wordsToHighlight={["println!"]}
  annotations={[
    { line: 2, message: "The main entry point.", style: "info" },
    { line: 3, message: "Prints to the console.", style: "success" }
  ]}
>{`
fn main() {
    // Entry point of every Rust program
    println!("Hello, Rustacean! 🦀");
}
`}</CodeBlock>

This code defines the <strong>main</strong> function, which is the entry point of every Rust program. The <code>println!</code> macro prints a message to your terminal.
