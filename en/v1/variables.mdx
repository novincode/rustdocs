# 📝 Variables in Rust: Simple, Safe, and Powerful

<Alert variant="success">
  <AlertTitle>What are variables?</AlertTitle>
  <AlertDescription>
    Variables let you store and work with data in your programs. In Rust, they’re safe, fast, and a little different from what you might know!

## ✨ Declaring Variables

<CodeBlock language="rust" showLineNumbers>{`let x = 5;
let mut y = 10;
let z: f64 = 3.14;`}</CodeBlock>

- `let` creates a variable (immutable by default)
- `mut` makes it mutable (you can change it)
- You can add a type (like `f64`) if you want

## 🔄 Changing Values (Mutability)

<CodeBlock language="rust" showLineNumbers>{`let mut y = 10;
y = 20;`}</CodeBlock>

    <strong>Tip:</strong> If you forget <code>mut</code>, Rust will give you a friendly error!

## 🕵️ Shadowing: Reuse Names, Change Types

<CodeBlock language="rust" showLineNumbers>{`let x = 5;
let x = x + 1;
let x = "now I'm a string!";`}</CodeBlock>

- Shadowing lets you reuse a variable name
- You can even change its type!

---

## 🧠 Best Practices

- Prefer immutability (`let`) unless you need to change the value
- Use clear, descriptive names
- Shadowing is great for transformations
- Type annotations are optional, but can help with clarity
