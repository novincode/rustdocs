# 🧠 Ownership in Rust

<Alert variant="success">
  <AlertTitle>Welcome to the heart of Rust!</AlertTitle>
  <AlertDescription>
    Ownership is what makes Rust memory-safe **without a garbage collector**. It’s unique, powerful, and once you “get it,” you’ll start seeing the magic.

## 🪄 What Is Ownership?

Think of variables in Rust as **owners of data**. When a variable owns a value, it’s **responsible** for cleaning it up when it’s no longer used.

<CodeBlock language="rust" showLineNumbers>{`fn main() {
    let s = String::from("hello");
    println!("{}", s);
}`}</CodeBlock>

Here, `s` **owns** the string `"hello"`. When `s` goes out of scope at the end of `main()`, Rust automatically cleans up the memory.

👉 No need to call `free()` or use a garbage collector!

---

## 🔁 Move: Ownership Transfer

When you assign a variable or pass it to a function, **ownership moves**:

<CodeBlock language="rust" showLineNumbers>{`fn main() {
    let s1 = String::from("hello");
    let s2 = s1; // Ownership moved to s2

    // println!("{}", s1); ❌ Error! s1 is no longer valid
    println!("{}", s2);
}`}</CodeBlock>

`s1` gives up ownership. Rust does this to **prevent double-free errors**. Only **one variable** owns the data at a time.

⚠️ This only happens for heap-allocated types like `String`. For simple types like integers, Rust **copies** instead of moves.

<CodeBlock language="rust" showLineNumbers>{`let x = 5;
let y = x; // ✅ x is still valid`}</CodeBlock>

---

## 📦 Functions and Ownership

Passing ownership into functions follows the same rules:

<CodeBlock language="rust" showLineNumbers>{`fn take_ownership(s: String) {
    println!("Got: {}", s);
} // s is dropped here

fn main() {
    let s = String::from("hello");
    take_ownership(s); // s is moved
    // println!("{}", s); ❌ Error!
}`}</CodeBlock>

If you want to **return ownership**, you can!

<CodeBlock language="rust" showLineNumbers>{`fn give_back(s: String) -> String {
    s
}

fn main() {
    let s1 = String::from("hi");
    let s2 = give_back(s1); // s1 moved, s2 owns it now
}`}</CodeBlock>

---

## 🧬 Cloning (Explicit Copying)

If you want to **make a real copy** of heap data, use `.clone()`:

<CodeBlock language="rust" showLineNumbers>{`let s1 = String::from("hey");
let s2 = s1.clone(); // Deep copy

println!("s1: {}, s2: {}", s1, s2); // ✅ Both work`}</CodeBlock>

Cloning can be expensive, so Rust makes it **explicit** — only clone when you really need to.

---

## 🧠 Summary

- Every value in Rust has an **owner**
- Ownership moves when variables are **assigned or passed** into functions
- Only one owner at a time — when the owner goes out of scope, the value is dropped
- Use `.clone()` if you need to **duplicate heap data**

Ownership may feel strict at first, but it prevents entire classes of bugs — no memory leaks, no crashes, no surprises 🦀✨
